# book-finder
A project that will store data about the books ive read and the order of the books in the shelves to help me find them.

## How to structure json data.

- Book info > name, description, isbn, if its been read or not.
- Book order > (calculate from data) book rating etc.
- Usage > how broken the book is from 1-100%, description.
