# Personal book finder

A project that will store data about the books I've read and the order of the books on the shelves to help me find them.

## How to structure JSON data.

- Book info > name, description, ISBN, if it's been read or not, how broken the book is from 1-100%, description, and width of each book.
- Shelf > width, amount of books (based on the width of the books. Move other books down to the next shelf if it doesn't fit).
- Book order > (calculate from data) book rating etc.

## Features

- A website that displays a shelf with all the backs of the books like in real life to easily find the ones I want in real life. I should also be able to drag-and-drop on the website to update the JSON. Also if you hover over a back on the shelf it should get a bit bigger and then if you right-click it should display the title and category and if you left-click it should change to a page about that book.
